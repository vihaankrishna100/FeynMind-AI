# FeynMind-AI
FeynMind AI is a study tool for students created by a student. Richard Feynman states that  when learning, students should be able to explain the topic fully in their own words, and be tested on it repeatedly. This application allows for students to interact with an AI model, encouraging the Feynman technique.
